## 2026-05-18 — Phase 0 scaffold

**Goal**: Install initial PJ structure per internal new-PJ install protocol.

**Changed**:

- Created PJ root at `C:/Users/admin/Projects/mcp-guard`
- Wrote 13 scaffold files: README, LICENSE, .gitignore, CLAUDE.md, spec.md, .claude/{settings.json, internal_notes.md, memory_bank/×5}, .github/{workflows/×2, dependabot.yml}, .pre-commit-config.yaml, docs/adr/0001-...
- Registered in internal PJ registry
- Initialized git, created GitHub PRIVATE repo `leagames0221-sys/mcp-guard`, pushed initial commit

**Status**: scaffold complete, awaiting `/spec-driven-workflow` Discovery to lock stack + adopt prior-art seeds.

**Next session**: Run Discovery stage (audit promptfoo + garak + llm-guard repos, decide adoption set, draft Requirements EARS).

## 2026-05-18 — Phase 1 Spec-Driven Workflow Stage 1+2+3 v2

**Goal**: Run Stage 1 Discovery → Stage 2 Requirements (EARS) → Stage 3 Design with independent review.

**Changed**:

- **Stage 1 Discovery accepted** — 4 prior-art seeds audited (promptfoo + garak primary, llm-guard + agent-governance-toolkit reference); stack locked = TypeScript + pnpm + vitest + commander + zod + Ollama gemma3:4b
- **Stage 2 Requirements accepted** — 29 EARS AC drafted, then expanded to 31 after independent review (added AC-005-6 exit codes + AC-NF-7 concurrent safety)
- **Stage 3 Design v2 accepted** — 7 initial tradeoffs (D-001 .. D-007); independent review identified 9 gaps; all 9 integrated → 4 new modules (src/config, src/logger, src/errors, src/scanners/mcp-schema), 4 new tradeoffs (D-008 .. D-011), 2 new EARS AC, 3 Phase 1 task additions, 5 new root files (.npmrc, .editorconfig, SECURITY.md, docs/EXIT_CODES.md, scripts/update-mcp-schema.ts)
- **ADR-0003 committed** (docs/adr/0003-stack-adoption-and-design.md) — consolidates Stage 1-3 decisions as canonical source of truth
- **spec.md updated** — added Spec status header, Stack section, full EARS (31 AC), Tradeoffs table (11 entries), File structure, Phase α completion AC

**Forbidden-phrase audit**: 1 violation found in CLAUDE.md L25 ("provisional, to be finalized in Discovery") fixed in commit 70aceff. All Stage outputs re-presented with production-grade framing per absolute enforcement rules.

**Status**: Stage 1-3 v2 deliverables saved to git. Stage 4 Tasks pending user approval to launch. No dependency installation yet (per ADR-0002 timing rule).

**Next session**: Stage 4 Tasks (WBS + Boundary/Depends + AC mapping). Then dependency installation batch (single pnpm install with lockfile commit) and Phase 1 implementation kickoff.
